Practing to test out of CSCE 146

The reasons I'm doing this in Java rather than C or C++ is to prepare to test out of CSCE 146. As much as I would like to take it I must test out of it to graduate on time.

I'm also doing some things from CSCE 350 since I have the textbook. I plan to add an AVL and a Red Black Tree once I can figure out how to balance the regular Binary Search Tree.

You know what they say right, presure makes diamonds.
